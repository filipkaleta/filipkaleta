ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Filip
   I'm a Year 1 PhD student in developmental psychology.
   Iâ€™m interested in gene-environment interplay in mental health, in particular the relationship between victimisation and depressive symptoms.
   I'm currently focused on twin model fitting, using structural equation modelling on twin data.
